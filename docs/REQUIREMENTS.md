### 1.2 Online Survey
An online Google Form was distributed among university students to collect feedback about what services they would like in a student-focused platform.  
The survey focused mainly on internship support and additional digital student services.

- **Participants:** 75 university students (responses still being collected)  
- **Purpose:** To identify students’ needs, frustrations, and expectations for a multi-service platform.

**Example Survey Questions:**
1. How do you currently find internship opportunities?  
2. What are the main challenges you face when applying for internships?  
3. Would you be interested in using a verified platform (like UniVerse) designed for university students to find internships?  
4. What features would you like UniVerse to include? (Community for students,Gamify study session,Event announcement,other)  
5. What feature should we add that would be most helpful for students?

**Key Findings:**
