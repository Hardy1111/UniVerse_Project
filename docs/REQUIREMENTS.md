# UniVerse – Requirements Specification

## 1. Requirements Elicitation

### 1.1 Techniques Used
To gather requirements for the **UniVerse** project, we applied **two elicitation techniques**:
1. **Online Survey**
2. **Team Brainstorming Session**

---

### 1.2 Online Survey
An online Google Form was distributed among university students to collect feedback about what services they would like in a student-focused platform.  
The survey focused mainly on internship support and additional digital student services.

- **Participants:** 75 university students (responses still being collected)  
- **Purpose:** To identify students’ needs, frustrations, and expectations for a multi-service platform.
- **Target group:** Students from different majors and academic years.

**Example Survey Questions:**
1. How do you currently find internship opportunities?  
2. What are the main challenges you face when applying for internships?  
3. Would you be interested in using a verified platform (like UniVerse) designed for university students to find internships?  
4. What features would you like UniVerse to include? (Community for students,Gamify study session,Event announcement,other)  
5. What feature should we add that would be most helpful for students?

**Key Findings:**
- Most students struggle to find and apply for internships easily.  
- Many want a **single platform** that includes multiple student services.  
- Students expect an **organized dashboard** to track internship and form submissions.  
- Community and Gamify Study session were highly requested.  
- Future interest in **Strong community** and **filtering system** was noted.

### 1.3 Brainstorming Session
A brainstorming session was held among all team members to refine the project’s concept and identify realistic features for the first release.

- **Participants:** All 5 UniVerse team members  
- **Purpose:** Combine individual ideas and prioritize the most feasible features.  
- **Approach:** Informal group discussion focused on practicality and user value.

**Ideas Generated:**
- Internship application and tracking system  
- Student medical record with QR access (future feature)    
- Student dashboard for status and notifications  
- Admin panel for approving/rejecting applications  
- Community and Gamify study session(future feature)

## 2. Requirements Classification

### 2.1 Purpose
The goal of this section is to organize and categorize all the raw requirements identified during the elicitation phase.  
Each requirement is classified based on its **type** (Functional or Non-Functional) and **level** (User or System).
